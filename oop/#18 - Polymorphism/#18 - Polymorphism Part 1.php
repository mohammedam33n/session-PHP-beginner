What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is a Greek word that literally means many forms. In object-oriented programming, polymorphism is closely related to inheritance.

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to respond differently based on the same message.

To implement polymorphism in PHP, you can use either abstract classes or interfaces.

Polymorphism helps you create a generic framework that takes the different object types that share the same interface.

Later, when you add a new object type to the system, you don’t need to change the framework to accommodate the new object type as long as it implements the same interface.

By using polymorphism, you can reduce coupling and increase code reusability
